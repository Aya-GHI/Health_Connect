# Health Connect 

This is a React-based web application for browsing doctors by specialty and making appointments. Each specialty has its own page (Dentists, Cardiologists, Ophthalmologists, Pediatrics, Dermatologists) and displays a mini-calendar for scheduling.

## Features

* Browse doctors by specialty or by filter (**the filter isn't fully working yet )
* View doctor information (name, specialty, address, photo)
* Make an appointment (button linked to calendar)
* Mini calendar for each doctor
* Responsive design with a consistent header across pages
* **Google Full Calendar integration**: currently displays a basic calendar; in the next version, it will be fully adjustable and show available time slots for each doctor.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your computer.

### 1. Extract the project

* Unzip the project folder to a location on your computer.

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Open a terminal inside the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the local backend (JSON Server)

The project uses `json-server` to simulate a backend API with the local `db.json` file. Run this command in the terminal inside the project folder:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
```

* This will start a local API server at `http://localhost:5000`.
* Each specialty has its own endpoint:

  * `/dentists`
  * `/cardiologists`
  * `/ophthalmologists`
  * `/pediatricians`
  * `/dermatologists`

> ⚠ Make sure the JSON Server is running **before** starting the frontend, otherwise doctor data will not load.

### 4. Start the frontend

In a **new terminal window** inside the project folder, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

* This will start the React development server.
* Open your browser and go to the displayed URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to view the app.

### 5. Navigate through specialties

* Use the navigation links or URLs to visit each specialty page:

  * `/dentists`
  * `/cardiology`
  * `/ophthalmology`
  * `/pediatrics`
  * `/dermatology`


 Notes
* Adding more doctors to `db.json` will automatically update the app.
* The **mini calendar currently shows basic dates**, but the next version will be enhanced to show **available appointment slots for each doctor** using the Google Full Calendar API.
* Ensure that both the JSON Server and frontend server are running simultaneously for full functionality.
